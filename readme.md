Example usage: `./quadtree.pl 13 | gs`

You'll need a postscript viewer for the quadtree example.

The houses example runs an HTTP server and serves an SVG to your browser. Run the swipl top level, load the 'app.pl' file by entering `?- [app].`, enter `?- start_server.` (optionally pass the port number as `start_server(PortNumber).`), then open `localhost:9987` in your browser (or whatever port number you passed in).
